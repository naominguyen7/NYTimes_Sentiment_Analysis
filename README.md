# NYTimes_Sentiment_Analysis

A 5-day project investigates headline sentiment of New York Times of section US vs section World over October 2016 - March 2017. I started with daily aggregate sentiment, monthly aggregate sentiment, and then word clouds to find out the topics of neutral, positive, and negative articles. 

With acknowlegdement of limitations in methodology, here is a summary  of results:
- The World articles is more negative than US articles on a monthly level
- November 2016 has the most positive sentiment score for US articles and the second highest in World articles
- Positive US articles most frequently mentioned "Supreme Court" and election-related terms ("win","lead") that do not neccessarily mean positivity while positve World articles most frequently talks mentioned peace.
- "Hillary" appeared in top 25 most frequent words in neutral and positive US articles but not negative US articles while "Trump" does in all three.
